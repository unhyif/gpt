      "\n",
      "5. Easy integration: Svelte can be easily integrated into existing projects, allowing developers to gradually adopt it without rewriting the entire codebase. It also provides a seamless integration with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks, making it flexible and adaptable.\n",
